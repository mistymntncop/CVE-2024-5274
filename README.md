# CVE-2024-5274
authors: @mistymntncop, @buptsb
Shoutout to @buptsb for his major contribution of discovering 
both the DCHECK bytecode mismatch POC and then discovering 
how to elevate that primitive to more powerful OOB read/write primitives.
Without him this exploit would not be possible :-)

based on the ITW exploit (author unknown) found by @_clem1, @btiszka
